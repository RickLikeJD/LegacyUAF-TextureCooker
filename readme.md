# 🎨 WiiUAF-TexCooker 🎨

**Transform your custom textures into Wii-ready formats for UbiArt games like Just Dance 2014 and beyond!**

This tool provides a simple way to convert your image files for use in your favorite UbiArt titles on the Nintendo Wii. Just drop your textures in, and let the magic happen! ✨

## 🚀 Features

* **Easy to Use:** Simply place your textures in the `input` folder.
* **Automatic Conversion:** The script handles the texture cooking process for you.
* **PIL Powered:** Leverages the powerful Pillow (PIL) library for image manipulation.
* **Wii Ready:** Outputs textures optimized for UbiArt games on the Nintendo Wii. (Note: Specific output format details would strengthen this section if you can provide them - e.g., "Converts to .tga/.dds with specific Wii parameters.")

## 📋 Requirements

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pillow Library:** If you don't have it installed, you can install it by running:
    ```bash
    pip install Pillow
    ```

## ⚙️ Usage

1.  **Prepare Your Textures:**
    * Make sure your custom textures are in a common image format (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.tga`, `.bmp`).
    * Place all the textures you want to convert into the `input` folder located in the same directory as the script.

2.  **Run the Script:**
    * Execute the Python script.

3.  **Get Your Cooked Textures:**
    * Voila! 🎉 Your converted textures will appear in the `output` folder.

## 🤔 How It Works

This script uses the Pillow library to open your input images, perform necessary transformations, and then saves them in a format compatible with the games.
