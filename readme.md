# 🎨 UbiArt Wii Texture Cooker 🎨

**Transform your custom textures into Wii-ready formats for UbiArt games like Just Dance 2014 and beyond!**

This tool provides a simple way to convert your image files for use in your favorite UbiArt titles on the Nintendo Wii. Just drop your textures in, and let the magic happen! ✨

## 🚀 Features

* **Easy to Use:** Simply place your textures in the `input` folder.
* **Automatic Conversion:** The script handles the texture cooking process for you.
* **PIL Powered:** Leverages the powerful Pillow (PIL) library for image manipulation.
* **Wii Ready:** Outputs textures optimized for UbiArt games on the Nintendo Wii. (Note: Specific output format details would strengthen this section if you can provide them - e.g., "Converts to .tga/.dds with specific Wii parameters.")

## 📋 Requirements

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pillow Library:** If you don't have it installed, you can install it by running:
    ```bash
    pip install Pillow
    ```

## ⚙️ Usage

1.  **Prepare Your Textures:**
    * Make sure your custom textures are in a common image format (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.tga`, `.bmp`).
    * Place all the textures you want to convert into the `input` folder located in the same directory as the script.

2.  **Run the Script:**
    * Execute the Python script.

3.  **Get Your Cooked Textures:**
    * Voila! 🎉 Your converted textures will appear in the `output` folder (or as specified by the script's logic).

## 🤔 How It Works (Simplified)

This script uses the Pillow library to open your input images, perform necessary transformations (like resizing, color palette adjustments, or format changes specific to Wii UbiArt requirements - *you might want to add more specific details here if you can!*), and then saves them in a format compatible with the games.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

* This tool is provided as-is. Always back up your original files before processing.
* Ensure your input textures are compatible with the general requirements of Wii homebrew and UbiArt modding.
* The specific "cooking" process for UbiArt games can be complex. This script aims to simplify common steps but may not cover every edge case or specific game requirement.
